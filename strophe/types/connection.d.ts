     *
     * ### Options
     *
     * With the options argument, you can specify boolean flags that affect how
     * matches are being done.
     *
     * Currently two flags exist:
     *
     * * *matchBareFromJid*:
     *     When set to true, the from parameter and the
     *     from attribute on the stanza will be matched as bare JIDs instead
     *     of full JIDs. To use this, pass {matchBareFromJid: true} as the
     *     value of options. The default value for matchBareFromJid is false.
     *
     * * *ignoreNamespaceFragment*:
     *     When set to true, a fragment specified on the stanza's namespace
     *     URL will be ignored when it's matched with the one configured for
     *     the handler.
     *
     *     This means that if you register like this:
     *
     *     >   connection.addHandler(
     *     >       handler,
     *     >       'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc',
     *     >       null, null, null, null,
     *     >       {'ignoreNamespaceFragment': true}
     *     >   );
     *
     *     Then a stanza with XML namespace of
     *     'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' will also be matched. If
     *     'ignoreNamespaceFragment' is false, then only stanzas with
     *     'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' will be matched.
     *
     * ### Deleting the handler
     *
     * The return value should be saved if you wish to remove the handler
     * with `deleteHandler()`.
     *
     * @param handler - The user callback.
     * @param ns - The namespace to match.
     * @param name - The stanza name to match.
